Band C is about the accessibility of the data. One challenge in data science is 'hearsay data'. Hearsay data is data which someone heard is being stored, so they say it's being recorded.

* Availability, is it actually being recorded?
* privacy or legal constraints on the accessibility of the recorded data, have ethical constraints been alleviated?
* Format: log books, PDF ...
* limitations on access due to topology (e.g. it's distributed across a number of devices)


At the end of Band C data is ready to be loaded into analysis software
(R, SPSS, Matlab, Python, Mathematica). Data that is in a
[data lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake) and available to
users would typically have been through Band C (e.g. it would be at C1 level).
